# Enter-Button-Chrome-Extention

With this chrome extenion you can enter whatever button you want with the Enter keyboard button on your keyboard.
All you have to do is change the query selector or request a more dynamic implementation and I will do it. You can
also request to work on this project as well to implement some desired changes directly. 

    Just download the folder
    Go to Chrome Extensions Manageer
    Turn on developer mode
    Drag and drop the folder or upload it via file manager
